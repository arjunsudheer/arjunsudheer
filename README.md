## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arjun

I'm a student at San Jose State University studying software engineering. My passion for software engineering first began when I joined my high school's robotics team. Now, I am exploring other areas like machine learning, cybersecurity, and full-stack web development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a research project that uses LLM agents to detect and respond to network-based attacks. This research project incorporates agentic-AI and software-defined networking (SDN) concepts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an AI-powered to-do list web application that can automate task management using agentic-AI and MCP.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love hiking, especially if the trail has a waterfall nearby!
